Data Augmentation Report:

Original dataset path: /home/ubuntu/pet_diagnosis_preprocessed.csv
Original dataset shape: (983, 6)

Kaggle dataset path: /home/ubuntu/pet_diagnosis_project/data/cleaned_animal_disease_prediction.csv
Kaggle dataset (Dogs and Cats only) shape: (147, 26)

Transformed Kaggle data for augmentation shape: (147, 6)

Augmented (combined) dataset path: /home/ubuntu/pet_diagnosis_augmented.csv
Augmented (combined) dataset shape: (1130, 6)

Columns in augmented dataset: ['Animal_Type', 'Age_Category', 'Primary_Condition', 'Severity', 'Treatment_Category', 'All_Symptoms']

Age Categorization Logic for Kaggle Data:
- Parsed 'Age' column (e.g., '2 months', '5 years').
- Mapped to 'Puppy', 'Kitten', 'Adult', 'Senior' based on Animal_Type and age.
  - Dog: <1 year = Puppy, 1-7 years = Adult, >7 years = Senior.
  - Cat: <1 year = Kitten, 1-7 years = Adult, >7 years = Senior.
  - Months were converted to years for categorization.

Symptom Combination Logic for Kaggle Data:
- Combined Symptom_1, Symptom_2, Symptom_3, Symptom_4.
- Incorporated boolean symptom flags (e.g., Vomiting, Diarrhea) as text symptoms.
- Created a single 'All_Symptoms' string, similar to the original dataset.

Missing Columns Handling (Severity, Treatment_Category):
- These columns were not present in the Kaggle dataset.
- They have been added to the augmented portion with the value 'Unknown'.
